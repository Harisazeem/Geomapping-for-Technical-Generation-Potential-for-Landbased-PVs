#Technical Generation Potential Mapping for Solar PV

The output files in this repository are state and county-level maps showing the technical generation potential (mostly in Million Mwh) for specific location within U.S. These are mapped on six states of interest: California, New York, Georgia, Massachusetts, Texas, and Nebraska. The analysis was done in collaboration with Fidelity Investments.
